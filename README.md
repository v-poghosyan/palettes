# About

This project is for learning React, and is heavily based on a Udemy React course by Colt Steele.

Palettes is a responsive React app that facilitates the creation, management, and access of color palettes for your next design project. Simply add colors using the built-in color picker or generate random ones. Use the drag and drop functionality to rearrange the order of the colors. Once your palette is ready, save it by giving it a name and a descriptive emoji. To access the colors in your palette all you have to do is adjust the lightness level of the colors, and click on a color box to copy its HEX, RGB, or RGBA values.
